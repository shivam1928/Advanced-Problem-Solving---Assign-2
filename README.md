# SSDAssignment3
Note:- Describing only what i changed from assignment_3_b


1. 
    * in function "getCommonLeader" (line 6) i make a function named as "getlsts" to reduce the independent componen and  hence the cyclometric complexcity reduced 
    and also call it in the same function "getCommonLeader" in line no 53 and return the corrosponding value 
    * in the function "getHeight " (line 58) made a function  named as "GH " which reduce the no of independent component (for loops which are independent to each other also ) and called that function"GH" and return it as previous assignment result 

2.  
    * in the function defination "checkingForamt" msde a function name "cF" in line no 15 
    then in line no 26 store the call it and store the return value of it in a variable named "ret "
    then return "ret"
    * in the function named "firstTypeInitializer" line no 30 defined a function "FTI"  which take which do the sme work as the privious function  "firstTypeInitializer" do in addition it reduce the independent conponent in the code so cyclomeric complexity reduces 
    then i called it again in the that function only ("firstTypeInitializer") and return it 

3. 
    this code is already fine no need to change it
